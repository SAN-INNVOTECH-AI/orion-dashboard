Implement a new particle style for Orion page inspired by:
- https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/the-magical-world-of-particles-with-react-three-fiber-and-shaders/
- curl.mp4 style (flowing, wispy, volumetric particle cloud)

CRITICAL:
1) Do NOT render a human face/bust anymore.
2) Make default /orion particle mode a flowing abstract AI cloud (curl-noise vibe), centered and beautiful.
3) Keep current architecture (plain Three.js + custom shaders), no migration to react-three-fiber.
4) Keep performance stable with <=12000 particles.
5) Keep full-screen background.
6) Ensure no vertical-strip artifact.

Files to update:
- client/src/components/three/ParticleSystem.tsx
- client/src/app/orion/page.tsx (default shape)
- client/src/components/voice/VoiceInterface.tsx and gesture mapping if needed to avoid face mode

Design direction:
- Use buffer attributes for per-particle randomness/phase.
- Vertex shader should create smooth flow/turbulence (multi-sine or pseudo curl-like drift) with stable center mass.
- Fragment shader should render soft luminous particles (not hard square voxels now).
- Color palette: cyan/white with subtle purple tint in glow.
- Modes can be:
  - swarm: diffuse cloud
  - neural: dense flowing core
  - circuit: structured stream/grid
- Remove face mode entirely from type + generators + mappings.

Also ensure UI overlay stays readable: particle alpha behind ORION text should be slightly reduced near center.

After edits run:
- cd client && npx next build

Then output concise summary of exact changes.
