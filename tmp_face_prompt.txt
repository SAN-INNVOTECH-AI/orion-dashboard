You are editing Orion Dashboard client code. Goal: make /orion particle look like a clear AI human face made of square particles (voxel style), similar to a front-facing cyan digital bust. Current implementation in client/src/components/three/ParticleSystem.tsx has generateFace but result is unclear. Rewrite only necessary parts for quality.

Requirements:
1) Keep existing architecture (single ParticleSystem, morph support).
2) Face mode must render a recognizable frontal human face + neck/shoulders silhouette in particle cloud.
3) Use square particles (already in fragment shader) and cyan palette.
4) Remove artifacts like vertical strip/random banding.
5) Keep performance acceptable (<= 12000 particles).
6) Keep AI modes names: swarm, circuit, neural, face.
7) Keep /orion default shape='face'.
8) Ensure build passes.

Implementation hint:
- Build face using implicit regions in normalized head space with weighted sampling:
  - oval head boundary
  - eye sockets, nose bridge/tip, cheekbones, lips/chin
  - neck cylinder and trapezius shoulders
- Bias more particles toward facial features so it reads clearly from distance.
- Keep z-depth subtle so face isn’t flat.
- For face mode reduce rotation heavily or nearly lock frontal view.

Also verify these files compile with TypeScript+Next lint:
- client/src/components/three/ParticleSystem.tsx
- client/src/app/orion/page.tsx (default should be face)

When done, print concise summary of exact edits.
