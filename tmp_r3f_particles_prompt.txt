Rework Orion particle renderer inspired by Maxime Heckel particle article techniques (attributes + shader animation), but keep existing app architecture (do NOT migrate to react-three-fiber).

Target files:
- client/src/components/three/ParticleSystem.tsx
- client/src/app/orion/page.tsx (only if needed for defaults)

Goals:
1) The face should look clearly like an AI human bust (head+neck+shoulders), front-facing.
2) Use attribute-driven variation (e.g., aRandom, aPhase, aScale, aRegion) for each particle.
3) Update shaders:
   - vertex shader: add per-particle drift/wobble using uTime + attributes (small, stable movement)
   - point size should vary per particle and with depth
   - keep composition stable/readable (no vertical strip)
   - minimal or near-zero rotation in face mode
   - fragment shader: square-ish glowing voxels (not circles), softer edges
4) Keep mode names: swarm, circuit, neural, face.
5) Keep particle count performant (max 12000).
6) Keep full-screen background behavior.
7) Keep TypeScript + build clean.

Important implementation notes:
- Use BufferGeometry custom attributes (Float32Array) and bind them as BufferAttributes.
- In shaders, consume these attributes to avoid flat/static look.
- For face mode, use weighted region sampling for features so face reads clearly from distance.
- Preserve morphing between modes (GSAP endArray allowed).

After edits, run `npx next build` in client and ensure success.
